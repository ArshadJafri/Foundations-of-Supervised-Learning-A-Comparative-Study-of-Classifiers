# ðŸ§ Supervised Classification

This project explores various classical supervised learning algorithms applied to structured datasets. The goal is to implement, compare, and evaluate models for classification tasks using both manual and library-based methods.

## ðŸ“Š Algorithms Implemented

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes (Gaussian and Multinomial)  
- Support Vector Machine (if applicable)  

## ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Steps

- Missing value handling  
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler  
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables  
- Train-test split and k-fold cross-validation

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC Curve (if binary classification)

## ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights

- Compared model performances on multiple datasets.  
- Visualized decision boundaries and learning curves.  
- Performed hyperparameter tuning and discussed trade-offs.  
- Documented conclusions based on metric comparison and generalization ability.
